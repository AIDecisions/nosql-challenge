A fictitious UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. A new contractor by the editors of a food magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", was hired to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

The contractor first loaded the data into a noSQL server and prepared the data. The preparation and cleaning process can be found on [NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb](./NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb).

Then contractor then addresses the following questions:

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?

The answers and the approached used to answer the questions can be found on [NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb](./NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb).
